"Captain...(cough)...You must help me...I must get to Redmond!",
"Redmond? Why?",
"I have a message for His Majesty's Governor Silehard. But I've been unable to leave this island because of the war...",
"An urgent message, I presume?",
"Urgent, of course...(cough)...must get to Redmond as soon as possible. I'm deathly ill...if I do not reach the governor soon, i fear the message will never get through.",
"Deathly ill? With what?",
"It's swamp-fever, God save me... I don't know how long I can continue to fight it. Will you take me on board?",
"It goes against my better judgment to put to sea with a man in your condition, but - all right. Promise to keep your distance, and I'll take you. My ship is moored at Greenford port. Her name is '",
"'.",
"We must set sail immediately, Captain ",
"! My strength...wanes with every passing minute.",
"I'm not sure I want to carry a cargo of swamp fever on my ship, if it's all the same to you. You could just entrust me with your message.",
"Save your breath and your strength. We'll be there soon!",
"No, no! It...is highly secret...entrusted to me. I must deliver it myself!",
"Very well.",
"I'm not sure you would survive the trip. Perhaps we should get you to a physician first.",
"No! The local doctors would only cover me in leeches and consign me to my death bed! The message...must get through.",
"I understand. I can't say I like it, but I understand.",
"Captain...",
"Come closer. Listen to me. I'm dying...but my message must be delivered...at any cost.",
"Just tell me, quickly. I'll pass it on to the governor and no one else. You have my word!",
"No...I have a letter. Take it. Place it in the governor's hands. The governor, and no other! Understand? No one else may lay eyes on it!",
"Relax, ",
".",
"Treasure...treasure waits there...",
"Raoul Rheims",
", he was so sure about it!...But there's just no way...",
"He's delirious. I fear we're losing him.",
"...Storm...tempest. Nothing we could do but drop anchor on...pirate island. Quebradas! Costillas. Now, the war...",
"What is he talking about?",
"The message! Message...for the governor. And, they wait...on Quebradas. Yes! Oh God, so much gol...",
"Gold? Do you mean gold? Make sense. Speak up!",
